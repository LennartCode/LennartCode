Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Lennart, currently studying Computer Science at [RWTH Aachen University](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/) in Germany and looking to graduate in 2023. I consider myself a member of the [Effective Altruism Community](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/) so if you have a project you could need some help with, feel free to reach out!

## My favourite technologies:
- [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/) for automation
- [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/de-de/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/) for object-oriented code
- [SQL](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) for talking to databases
- [Dart](https://dart.dev/) with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) for cross platform front end applications


## Topics I am interested in:
- Automatic speech recognition
- Graph databases, especially using SPARQL
- Data privacy
- Automation
- Usable, user-friendly interface design (UI/UX)
- REST APIs
- Agile project management

## Hiring
I am currently looking for a job with a workload of at most 10 hours per week, ideally remote or in the Aachen region. With 2 years of real live working experience (mostly automation using PowerShell) and 2 years of academic education, I love learning new technologies and building new ones.

If you think, I might be a fit, reach out!
