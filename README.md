Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Lennart, currently studying Computer Science at [RWTH Aachen University](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/) in Germany and looking to graduate in 2024. I consider myself a member of the [Effective Altruism Community](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/) so if you have a project you could need some help with, feel free to reach out!

## My favourite technologies:
- [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/) for automation
- [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/de-de/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/) for object-oriented code
- [SQL](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) for talking to databases
- [Dart](https://dart.dev/) with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) for cross platform front end development

## Topics I am interested in:
- Software Engineering
- Data privacy
- Agile project management
- REST APIs
- Automatic speech recognition
- Graph databases, especially using SPARQL
- Automation
- Usable, user-friendly interface design (UI/UX)
